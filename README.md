# E-Mail-Spam-Filteration
A Python-based project that automatically classifies emails as spam or legitimate using Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest. Includes text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF) and a feedback loop for continuous model improvement.

# Email/SMS Spam Detection System (Machine Learning)

A production-ready machine learning system to classify **Email/SMS messages** as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using classical NLP and supervised learning techniques.

This project is designed with **ML engineering best practices**, focusing on clean architecture, reproducibility, and business-driven evaluation.

---

## Problem Statement

Spam messages cause financial loss, security risks, and poor user experience.  
The goal of this project is to build a **reliable and interpretable spam detection system** that:

- Minimizes **false positives** (important emails marked as spam)
- Maximizes **spam recall**
- Is fast, explainable, and deployable

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** Kaggle – SMS Spam Collection Dataset
- **Type:** Text (Unstructured)
- **Classes:**
  - `Ham` → Legitimate messages
  - `Spam` → Unwanted or malicious messages
- **Challenge:** Class imbalance (more ham than spam)

> Raw dataset is stored without modification for reproducibility.

## Approach Overview

### 1. Text Preprocessing (Minimal, Signal-Preserving)
- Remove HTML tags and email headers
- Normalize whitespace
- Convert text to lowercase
- Replace URLs and email addresses with tokens
- **Keep punctuation signals (`! ? $`)**
- Avoid over-cleaning to preserve spam indicators

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Word n-grams (1–2)
- Sublinear TF scaling
- Rare and overly frequent term filtering

### 3. Model Selection
- **Logistic Regression**
- Class weighting to handle imbalance
- Chosen for:
  - Interpretability
  - Speed
  - Industry adoption

### 4. Decision Threshold Optimization
- Default threshold adjusted from `0.50` → `0.27`
- Improves spam recall while maintaining high precision

## Results

### Final Performance (Threshold = 0.27)

| Metric        | Ham     | Spam |
|---------------|---------|------|
| Precision     | 1.00    | 0.94 |
| Recall        | 0.99    | 0.97 |
| F1-Score      | 0.99    | 0.95 |
| Accuracy      | **99%** |

##  How to Run the Project

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Model
```bash
python src/train.py
```

### 3. Evaluate the Model
```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```

## Key Engineering Decisions

- Avoided deep learning due to small dataset size

- Focused on feature engineering over model complexity

- Explicit threshold tuning based on business tradeoffs

- Clean separation between experimentation and production code

## Model Artifacts

Saved in `models/`:

- `spam_classifier.pkl` → Trained Logistic Regression model

- `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl` → TF-IDF feature transformer
